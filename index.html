            <h2>About me:</h2>
            <p>My name is Yehonatan Bronstein, I am 18 years old and was born in Tel Aviv, Israel.<br>
            I graduated from Alpharetta high school in 2022 and started learning coding in a bootcamp at Georgia Tech.<br>
            I also take much interest in other computer things that arent related to coding such as producing music, playing video games and staying connected with media.<br>
